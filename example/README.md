# CircomkitFFI Example

This is an example that demonstrates the [usage](../README.md#usage) chapter of Circomkit FFI.

Install everything with:

```sh
bun install
```

We use `tsx` as well, which will allow you to run the code with NodeJS as well. In other words, you can run the code with any of the following:

```sh
# using Bun runtime
bun run index.ts

# using Node runtime
npx tsx index.ts
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> If you are using `CircomkitFFIBun`, you won't be able to run with Node runtime.
